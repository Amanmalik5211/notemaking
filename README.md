step -1 Created backend and frontend setup with type Script support.

frontend run command - npm run dev
backend run command - npm run dev

********************* PROBLEMS FACED ***************************
1.) Since i was using login with google so I have to add google_client_id and google_client_secret, so gitHub was not pushing my code due to security, I manually upload files then 


============================================================================================================================================================

********************* IMPORTANT NOTE ****************************

I have used render free version for deployment so it automatically shuts when no one is using for 15 minutes, so, when you login it will initially take 10-15 seconds on on backend.
